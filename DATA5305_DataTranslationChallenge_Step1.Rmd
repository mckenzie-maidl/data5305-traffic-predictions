# Step 1: Explore the data and perform in-sample evaluations

```{r}
# imports
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# upload data
traffic <- read.csv('Data/traffic.csv')

# take just one junction
traffic <- traffic %>% 
  filter(Junction == 1)

# take subset of columns
traffic <- traffic[c('DateTime', 'Vehicles')]

# view data
head(traffic)
```

```{r}
# create time series
ts <- ts(traffic$Vehicles, start=c(2015,11), frequency=24*60) # minutes per day (is this wrong?)
plot(ts)
```
